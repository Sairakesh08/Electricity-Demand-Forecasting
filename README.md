# Electricity Demand Forecasting: A Comparative Analysis of Baseline and LSTM Models
Overview
This project focuses on forecasting electricity demand using historical time-series data. The main goal is to compare the performance of traditional baseline models (like linear regression or ARIMA) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, a type of deep learning model. Time-series forecasting plays a crucial role in predicting electricity consumption, which helps in efficient resource planning, grid management, and energy policy-making. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of both baseline and LSTM models, the project aims to identify the most accurate approach for electricity demand forecasting.

Objective
The key objectives of this project are:

To explore and forecast electricity demand using different models.
To conduct a comparative analysis between a baseline model and an LSTM model to understand their performance.
To evaluate the models' effectiveness in predicting future electricity demand, considering factors such as seasonality, trends, and noise in the data.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical electricity consumption data. This data is typically recorded at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, or monthly. The dataset contains the following main variables:

Timestamp: A time label indicating when the electricity consumption was recorded.
Demand: The quantity of electricity consumed, typically measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) or megawatts (MW).
Common sources for such datasets include:

UCI Machine Learning Repository: The Individual Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset.
Kaggle: Various electricity consumption datasets that provide hourly or daily usage data.
The dataset usually includes both short-term and long-term trends, seasonal patterns (e.g., higher demand during winter), and potential outliers or noise.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This is crucial for improving model accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Time-based features are often created from the timestamp, such as day of the week, hour of the day, or month. These features help capture seasonal and cyclical patterns in electricity demand.
Normalization: Both baseline models and LSTM models often require the data to be normalized or scaled to improve performance.
2. Modeling:
Baseline Models: A traditional baseline model (like Linear Regression or ARIMA) is used as a benchmark for comparison. These models rely on simpler statistical methods to predict future values based on past observations.
LSTM Model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly effective for time-series forecasting due to its ability to learn from both short-term and long-term dependencies in the data. LSTM models are more sophisticated and can capture complex patterns in time-series data, including trends and seasonal fluctuations.
3. Model Evaluation:
Both models are evaluated using common forecasting metrics, including:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
Cross-validation: To ensure robust model performance, cross-validation is performed, particularly for the LSTM model, to assess how well it generalizes to unseen data.
4. Comparison:
After training both models, the results are compared based on their forecasting accuracy and performance metrics. This analysis helps determine the effectiveness of the LSTM model versus the baseline model in predicting electricity demand.
Results
The results of this project will provide a clear comparison between baseline models (e.g., Linear Regression, ARIMA) and LSTM models in the context of electricity demand forecasting. Some key findings may include:

The baseline model's performance in capturing trends and seasonality.
The LSTM model's ability to better account for complex dependencies in the data and provide more accurate predictions.
Insights into how well each model can forecast future electricity demand and handle challenges like data noise and seasonal variations.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of both traditional statistical methods and modern deep learning techniques for electricity demand forecasting. The comparative analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of baseline models versus LSTM models. The findings can guide energy planners, utilities, and policymakers in selecting the most appropriate forecasting model for predicting electricity demand.

Future Work
Some potential areas for future work include:

Exploring other advanced machine learning models, such as GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) or Transformer-based models, for time-series forecasting.
Investigating the impact of external factors (e.g., weather, holidays) on electricity demand predictions.
Applying the models to real-time forecasting and developing a production-grade solution.
